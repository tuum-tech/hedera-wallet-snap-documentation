## How to call the API from an app

Hedera Wallet Snap connects to your currently connected Metamask account by default. To learn how apps can connect to Hedera Wallet Snap using a non-metamask(external) account, refer to this [documentation](../#connecting-to-a-non-metamask-external-account).&#x20;

Then, depending on whether you're trying to connect to a metamask account or a non-metamask account, you can call the snap API in the following way:

```tsx
const snapId = `npm:@hashgraph/hedera-wallet-snap`

const getSmartContractBytecodeAPI = async () => {
  const externalAccountParams = {
    externalAccount: {
      accountIdOrEvmAddress: '0.0.12345',
      curve: 'ED25519'
    }
  }

  await window.ethereum.request({
    method: 'wallet_invokeSnap',
    params: {
      snapId,
      request: {
        method: 'hscs/getSmartContractBytecode',
        params: {
          network: 'testnet',
          contractId: '0.0.4409710'
          /* 
            Uncomment the below line if you want to connect 
            to a non-metamask account
          */
          // ...externalAccountParams
        }
      }
    }
  })
}
```

## What the API does

1. Retrieves the currently connected account the user has selected on Metamask. If it's the first time, a new [snap account](../../snap-account.md) is created and the account info is saved in snap state.
2. Parses the arguments that were passed such as the gas, bytecode, adminKey, etc.
3. Calls the [Hedera SDK Get Smart Contract Bytecode API](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/smart-contracts/get-smart-contract-bytecode) to query the network that returns the bytecode for a smart contract instance.
4. Returns the transaction receipt as response

An example response:

```json
{
    "currentAccount": {
        "metamaskEvmAddress": "0x0b3628d1b838993b5fceec8b2a26502e7a8e5241",
        "externalEvmAddress": "",
        "hederaAccountId": "0.0.3581604",
        "hederaEvmAddress": "0xca53f9c93d30e0b7212d67901e5a24fb090d542b",
