# Snap Permissions

Snaps run in an isolated environment within MetaMask and don't have default access to certain JavaScript globals or Metamask JSON-RPC methods. Hedera Wallet Snap seeks user permissions in compliance with the [EIP-2255 wallet permissions specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2255) to access specific features, ensuring a secure and controlled experience. Refer to [Metamask Snap Permissions documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps-permissions.html) to learn more about snap permissions.
